SOLID PRINCIPLES

☝️ SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY
A class should have only one sole purpose.

🙃 OPEN CLOSED
A class should be open for extension and closed for modification.

😉 LISKOV SUBSTITUTION
The derived class should obey the contract of the base or parent class.

😌 INTERFACE SEGREGATION
Split the larger interfaces to smaller ones.
Don't force classes to override methods that they can't do
